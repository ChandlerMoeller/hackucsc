This is an android app cooperatively created by Brian, Chris, and Chandler for Hack UCSC 2016. This app is essentially two great ideas in one for an all around great music or media experience. It combines the fine tuning and customization of an android device's sound as well as social and sharing aspects for sharing one's music tastes with those around them for an all around great media experience for mediaphiles and casual media users alike.

Our team fully realizes that a user may not want to use all the features that this app has for one reason or another, so we have implemented the ability to turn on or off key features.
This app has two main features:

#1) Audio Adjustment based on background noise
The app lets the user choose a high and low bounds for the audio to stay within. The app will then change the audio within these bounds dependent on the background noise.
A loud background will make the app raise the volume in order to ensure that the user can enjoy their music or media without
interruption. Similarly, with a quiet background or no background noise the app will keep the volume at the lower bound.

#2) Sharing your music tastes with those around you
Imagine sitting in a lecture hall, walking to class or even eating at a dining hall and wondering what your peers are currently listening to. Well, this app will allow you to do that and even allows you to optionally share and see a person's favorite genres along with the song information. This makes finding new music you enjoy as easy as ever by allowing you to see what others with similar music interests are listening to.

When this feature is on this app will detect what song you are currently listening to and upload it to the cloud along with the album, artist and optionally your favorite genres and a username. In addition, location is also needed and sent to the server bundled with the other information, in what we call Ghost Trails, so that it can be shared locally with those around you. Your phone will retrieve all the Ghost Trails within a set distance from you by other users via the cloud.
