This is an android app created by Brian, Chris, and Chandler for Hack UCSC 2016.

This app has two main features:

#1) Audio Adjustment based on background noise
The app lets the user choose a high and low bounds for the audio to stay within. The app will then change the audio within these bounds dependent on the background noise.
Such that a loud background will make the app raise the volume in order to ensure that the user can enjoy their music or media without
interruption. Similarly, with a quiet background or no background noise the app will keep the volume at the lower bound.

#2) Sharing your music tastes with those around you
